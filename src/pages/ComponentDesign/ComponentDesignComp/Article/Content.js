export let HorizontalArm =  `Horizontal tail moment arm is the distance between 
the wing's and the horizontal tail's mean aerodynamic chord. It is 
the crucial parameter for longitudinal stability. For RC aircraft, 
it can be defined as distance between wing's and chord's leading edge instead`

export let VerticalArm = `The vertical tail moment arm is the distance between the wing's 
mean aerodynamic chord and the vertical tail's mean aerodynamic chord. This is a crucial 
parameter for directional stability and can also be defined in the same manner as the horizontal arm.`

export let wingArea = `Wing area is the wing's top view projected area. It is the significant parameter used to
determine amount of weight that the aircraft can carry; moreover, it can predict the flight characteristic as well.`

export let wingType = `The wing area can be mainly categorized into two main types, which are rectangular and taper wing.
For the rectangular wing, it is simpler to be constructed compared to the taper wing. For the taper wing, it provides the
better flight characteristic such as stabilty. `

export let wingSpan = `Wingspan is the distance between the tips of an aircraft's wing when they are fully extended. 
It affects how much lift it can generate and how stable it is during flight. Longer wingspan can provide more lift and 
reduce drag but may reduce maneuverability.`

export let taperedRatio = `Taper ratio describes the ratio of the wing's root chord to its tip chord.A low taper ratio can 
provide better low-speed handling, while a high taper ratio can provide high-speed performance.The conventional taper ratio
for RC aircraft is between 0.4-0.7`

export let fuselageLength = `The fuselage length is calculated based on historical trend according to the RC aircraft textbook
the required parameters consist of horizontal tail chord, horizontal tail arm, and mean aerodynamic chord`
